# Slime Slasher
This is another project I made years ago, a game of my own that I've worked on intermittently for years.
You can play it online [here](https://voidwatcher1331.itch.io/slime-slasher)
or you can download SlimeFighter Windows Build.zip and unzip it to play from your computer.
As long as you keep using the same browser/computer, your progress and settings should be saved, though there isn't a good way to transfer progress.
